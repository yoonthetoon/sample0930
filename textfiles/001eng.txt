A pulley is a tool that converts a small force into a larger force by being placed on a wheel, and an axle wheel is a tool that fixes two wheels of different sizes onto a single axis to lift a heavy object with a small force. 
A fixed pulley provides no mechanical advantage in terms of force, but only changes the direction of the applied force.A movable pulley allows an object to be lifted with half the force, but the object only rises half the distance of the length pulled.In the case of an axle wheel, the force required is reduced by the ratio of the small wheel's radius to the large wheel's radius, but the lifted distance is reduced by the same ratio.
